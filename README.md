This repository contains code used in the project in order to convert street and blocks into latitudes and longitudes. There is also code to convert x and y coordinates for singapore to latitude and longitude. Latitude and longitude is needed as it is required to get the distance betweent the resale flats and public transport or amenitites. The distances help us to build a perimeter of the facilities surrounding a resale flat in order to determine how well suited it is for each specific user.
